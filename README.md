# Octopussy
Java CLI uses Octopus API to analyse Agile tariff electricity consumption.
The recent cost saving is shown compared to the flat rate tariff.
The day ahead unit pricing is shown, together with the best times to start an activity.

The jar has been tested (unchanged) on Raspberry Pi OS and Windows 10.
n.b.
For Windows users running the jar in a console, ANSI colour support should be enabled if not already.

One way to do this is to  use the Registry Editor to
set REG_DWORD VirtualTerminalLevel=1 for Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console

Then relaunch a cmd.exe
