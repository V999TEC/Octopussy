# Octopussy
Java CLI uses Octopus API to analyse Agile tariff electricity consumption.  
The recent cost saving is shown compared to the flat rate tariff.  
The day ahead unit pricing is shown, together with the best times to start an activity.

The jar has been tested (and works unchanged, such is the beauty of java) on Raspberry Pi OS and Windows 10.

n.b.
For Windows users running the jar in a console, ANSI colour support should be enabled if not already.

One way to do this is to  use the Registry Editor to
set REG_DWORD VirtualTerminalLevel=1 for Computer\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Console

![EXAMPLE](/assets/Octopussy4.JPG?raw=true "Picture 4")

Then relaunch a cmd.exe

![EXAMPLE](/assets/Octopussy6.JPG?raw=true "Picture 6")

The first parameter passed to the jar indicates the number of columns to create on the right hand side of the display.
The second parameter is the name of a property file containing details of the tariffs and other configuration data plus the api.key
Since the property file needs to hold the api.key do not share this property file.

If no property file is specified, a default built into the jar will be used. Obviously this does not have the correct api.key or meter reference numbers etc so an exception will be generated.
Once you have established your own properties file with the correct details, it is possible to use something like 7-Zip to replace the builtin octopussy.properties in the jar with your preferences.
The only advantage is that the external properties file is no longer needed and need not be specified each time java -jar octopussy.jar N is called
As before, do not share anything containing your api.key and that includes the jar that you might have just customised.

The recommended approach is to keep the personalised property file external and always pass its name as the second parameter.

The builtin octopussy.properties can be used to generate a template so that you have an idea of all the possible settings that drive the program

To display the template do the following:

delete the octopus.import.csv file if it exists

```
java -jar octopussy.jar
```
This will cause the program to display the properties so that you can copy paste into your own property file (let's say it's called My.properties)

Alternatively you could just pipe the output directly to a file name of your choice

```
java -jar octopussy.jar 1>My.properties
```

After editing the property file just created to fix the apiKey etc., remember to specify the file name each time as the second parameter, i.e.:

```
java -jar octopussy.jar 7 My.properties
```



Obviously the task requiring electricity generally won't use it evenly across the period, so the program is just a guide, but it's better then a random choice.

By default, the display will show a vertical bar to the right of the asterisks that indicate the unit cost in each 30 minute period
A parameter value larger than value 0 will display a 24 hour time stamp HH:MM to assist when viewing the (potentially many) rows
Values larger than 1 will display increasingly more columns, containing average prices for periods of 1hr, 1.5, 2hr, 2.5 3hr... etc up to 9.5

n.b. Typically daily pricing data does not go beyond 22:30 and will be updated around 4pm by Octopus
This means that sometimes the number of columns is truncated, because it is not possible to determine with certainty the cheapest time to start an activity when the end of the period goes beyond the range of available pricing.  Try playing with differnt values and you'll soon get the picture ;-)

## Bonus feature(1)

You can always display the template version of the octopussy.properties (which is embedded in the jar) as follows:

delete the octopus.import.csv file if it exists

delete the octopussy.properties if it exists

```
java -jar octopussy.jar
```
This will cause the program to display the properties so that you can copy paste into your own property file

Alternatively you could just pipe the output directly to a file name of your choice

```
java -jar octopussy.jar 1>My.properties
```

After editing the property file just created to fix the apiKey etc., remember to specify the file name each time as the second parameter, i.e.:

```
java -jar octopussy.jar 8 My.properties
```
When you are happy your property file is how you want it and you are comfortable with using 7-Zip to open the jar file archive, you could copy your property file contents over the octopussy.properties in the root of the jar

The advantage then is that you don't need to  specify My.properties each time you run the jar.

In this way the jar has been personalised, so don't give it to anyone without realising that they will be able to use your apiKey.

## Bonus feature(2)


When the program starts it will look for octopus.import.csv

If it doesn't exist it will create the file and build up history data each time the program has run

The file is useful if you want to import into a spreadsheet etc.

The columns are 
```
Consumption (kWh), Start, End, Price
```

## Advanced  - show Agile Export prices too

![EXAMPLE](/assets/Octopussy5.JPG?raw=true "Picture 5")

The above example use export=true in the [name].properties file with color=YELLOW to highlight the export prices with ansi=true


Not only is the righthand side showing the best import prices it is showing the best times for export.

For example, the best 30-min slot for export is 6:00 pm at a price of 19.12p and at 3,800 watt export rate one might earn as much as 36p:wink:

The highlighted prices on the righthand side are showing _average_ prices averaged over the respective period from 1 hr upwards left to right.

Here we can see that the best 2-hour export period starts at 5pm with an average price of 17.01p over those 2 hours.

If we were to delay the 2-hour export to 18:30 then the average price would drop to 13.60p

The rate at which one can export will obviously vary from installation to installation.  
Let's say one limits to 3kW for 3 hours because we have sufficient battery storage available. 
On this particular day, the best time to start the export would be 16:00 and the 9 units exported would be worth 9 x 17.88p (Â£1.61 ~ish) 

N.B. By default, *import* average prices are shown. If they are red (or whatever *color* value has been chosen) they are highest average *export* prices.
If they are green (or whatever *colour* has been chosen, such as GREEN in the example) then they indicate the lowest average *import* prices.

## Bonus feature(3)

In the properties file the key values yearly, monthly, weekly can be set to true or false to produce an analysis over the respective period, for example:

![EXAMPLE](/assets/Octopussy3.JPG?raw=true "Picture 3")

Note the *Recent daily results* are always shown and the days=number in the properties file will guide the number of days to be included in what is considered recent.
The recent data is used to calculate the running average (A) price which dictates where the 'A' is positioned within the asterisks of the horizontal graph

When the consumption results for a day are incomplete, the day is dropped, so the days=N will not always match the number of days actually shown.
